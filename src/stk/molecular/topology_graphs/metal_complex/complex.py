        Initialize a :class:`.Cage`.

        Parameters
        ----------
        building_blocks : :class:`iterable` or :class:`dict`
            Can be a :class:`iterable` of :class:`.BuildingBlock`
            instances, which should be placed on the topology graph.

            Can also be a :class:`dict` which maps the
            :class:`.BuildingBlock` instances to the ids of the
            vertices it should be placed on. A :class:`dict` is
            required when there are multiple building blocks with the
            same number of functional groups, because in this case
            the desired placement is ambiguous.

        vertex_alignments : :class:`dict`, optional
            A mapping from the id of a :class:`.Vertex`
            to an :class:`.Edge` connected to it.
            The :class:`.Edge` is used to align the first
            :class:`.FunctionalGroup` of a :class:`.BuildingBlock`
            placed on that vertex. Only vertices which need to have
            their default edge changed need to be present in the
            :class:`dict`. If ``None`` then the default edge is used
            for each vertex. Changing which :class:`.Edge` is used will
            mean that the topology graph represents different
            structural isomers. The edge is referred to by a number
            between ``0`` (inclusive) and the number of edges the
            vertex is connected to (exclusive).

        reaction_factory : :class:`.ReactionFactory`, optional
            The reaction factory to use for creating bonds between
            building blocks.

        num_processes : :class:`int`, optional
            The number of parallel processes to create during
            :meth:`construct`.

        Raises
        ------
        :class:`ValueError`
            If the there are multiple building blocks with the
            same number of functional_groups in `building_blocks`,
            and they are not explicitly assigned to vertices. The
            desired placement of building blocks is ambiguous in
            this case.
